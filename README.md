# CynthionScripts
Python scripts written for the Cynthion by Great Scott Gadgets

Before running a script, make sure you have connected the device and run the "cynthion run facedancer" command

usb-keyboard-random-fuzz.py - This script is designed to use the Cynthion device to simulate a USB keyboard, with random buttons and modifiers (ctrl, alt, etc.) being pressed repeatedly
usb-keyboard-command-spamming.py - This script is designed to use the Cynthion to act as a USB keyboard and repeatedly send a user-specified keyboard command at a high frequency.  It is useful to test specific keyboard commands while a device is rebooting.
